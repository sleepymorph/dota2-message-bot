# dota2-message-bot
python project, what does it do? the bot will spam you(on telegramm), when the game is found.

make your bot: open botfather, menu press newbot choose name for your bot, after do nickname that ends on bot like dota2bot, megabot, whatever it is, it must end on bot. it will say your api, go and paste it to the telegrambot.py


to make it work add your id in line 9(telegrambot.py), and copy your path to image and paste to line 39. find userinfobot, press start he will give you your telegramm id, open your cmd, write in cd (your path, example: "C:\Users\user\Downloads\dota2-message-bot\requirements.txt"), then "pip install -r requirements.txt". if you want to make it work more properly (it will open when you turn on your computer), press ctrl + shift + esc(it will open task mananger), go to startup apps, run new task then press browse and find start.bat in the dota2-message-bot. thats it, it works i guess.
