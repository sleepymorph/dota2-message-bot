# dota2-message-bot
python project, what does it do? the bot will spam you(on telegramm), when the game is found, telegramm bot is @dota2messagebot

to make it work add your id in line 9(telegrambot.py), find userinfobot, press start he will give you id, also open your cmd, write in cd (your path, example: "C:\Users\user\Downloads\dota2-message-bot\requirements.txt"). if you want to make it work more properly, press ctrl + shift + esc, go to startup apps, run new task then press browse and find start.bat in the dota2-message-bot. thats it, it works i guess.
